# ***Classification Project***
This section consists of capstone projects related to the classification. Projects are :

1. *Gene Expression*
   - In Gene Expression, we have to predict whether cancer is present or not according to given gene value.
   - Here, we have to predict with highest accuracy by applying multiple classification algorithm.
3. *Mouse Viral Study*
   - In Mouse Viral Study, we have to predict whether virus is present or not.
5. *Mushrooms*
   - Here, we have to predict whether the mushroom is eatable or poisonous.
7. *Penguins Size*
   - From given penguins size , we have to predict from which species penguins belongs.
9. *Loan Data*
   - We have to predict whether a person is eligible for loan or not.
